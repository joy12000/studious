feat(UI): Refine homepage layout, gradient, and fix dark mode TOC color

This commit addresses several UI refinements and bug fixes:

- **Homepage Headline:** Adjusted the animation speed, font size, and vertical positioning of the 'STUDIOUS' headline for improved aesthetics.
- **Gradient Text Fix:** Resolved a rendering bug where the animated gradient text appeared as a solid box by adding `display: inline-block` and `background-color: transparent` to the CSS.
- **Dark Mode Primary Color:** Updated the primary blue color in dark mode to a much darker, more subtle shade as per user feedback.
- **TextbookPage TOC Color Fix:** Added a CSS rule to ensure that Markdown table of contents links are clearly visible in dark mode.
