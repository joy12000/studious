refactor: Complete ChatPage refactor and update navigation

This refactoring includes several major changes:

1.  **Rename ChatPage to TextbookPage:** The existing page at `/chat` has been renamed to `TextbookPage` and its route has been updated to `/textbook` to better reflect its function as a note-specific chat.

2.  **Refactor ChatUI Component:** The `ChatUI` component has been updated to make note-specific props (`noteId`, `noteContext`, `onClose`, `onSuggestionAccepted`) optional. This allows the component to be reused in a general, non-note-related context.

3.  **Create New ChatPage:** A new, general-purpose `ChatPage` has been created at the `/chat` route. This page features the `ChatUI` component in a full-screen, open layout for conversations not tied to a specific note.

4.  **Update Navigation Bar:** A link to the new `ChatPage` has been added to the main navigation sidebar. The navigation items have also been reordered for a more logical and user-friendly experience.
