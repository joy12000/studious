feat: Add direct camera capture button to mobile upload page

This commit enhances the mobile upload page by adding a dedicated button for direct camera capture.

- Implemented a new button that triggers the device's camera directly using `input type="file" capture="environment"`.
- Integrated the captured photo into the existing multi-file upload workflow, allowing it to be added to the list of selected files.
