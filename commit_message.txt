fix: Correct Supabase Storage upload error handling in backend API

The backend API (api/add-synced-media.py) was incorrectly checking for `response.status_code` after a Supabase Storage upload, leading to a 500 error. This commit updates the code to correctly check `response.error` for upload failures, resolving the issue.
